## üöÄ How to Test the Organization System

### Step 1: Create an Organization
1. Navigate to `/create-organization`
2. Fill in organization details:
   - Organization Name: "My Test Company"
   - URL Slug: "my-test-company" (must be unique)
   - Description: "A test organization"
   - Plan: Select any plan (FREE, BASIC, PRO, ENTERPRISE)
3. Click "Create Organization"
4. Should redirect to `/organization/dashboard`

### Step 2: Verify Organization Dashboard
1. Should see organization stats cards
2. Should display organization name and plan
3. Should show member count, events, etc.
4. All data should be loading from Supabase

### Step 3: Test Member Management
1. Go to `/organization/members`
2. Should see current user as OWNER
3. Try inviting new members (requires email)
4. Test role changes (if you have multiple users)

### Step 4: Test Event Spaces
1. Go to `/organization/spaces`
2. Should see default "General" space created automatically
3. Try creating new event spaces
4. Verify spaces are saved to database

### Step 5: Test Settings
1. Go to `/organization/settings`
2. Try updating organization details
3. Test different organization settings
4. Verify changes are saved

## üîß Database Functions Available

The following functions are implemented and ready to use:

```sql
-- Create new organization
SELECT create_organization('My Org', 'my-org', user_id, 'Description', 'FREE');

-- Add user to organization  
SELECT add_user_to_organization(user_id, org_id, admin_id, 'USER');

-- Remove user from organization
SELECT remove_user_from_organization(user_id, org_id, admin_id);

-- Get organization stats
SELECT * FROM organization_dashboard_stats WHERE organization_id = 'org-id';
```

## üìä Database Views Available

```sql
-- Organization dashboard statistics
SELECT * FROM organization_dashboard_stats;

-- Organization admin requests (for role management)
SELECT * FROM organization_admin_requests;
```

## üîê Security Features Implemented

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Users can only see their organization's data
   - Proper isolation between organizations
   - Admin-only operations properly restricted

2. **API Authentication**
   - All endpoints require authentication
   - Organization membership verification
   - Role-based access control

3. **Data Validation**
   - Required field validation
   - Unique slug enforcement
   - Proper error handling

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Organization Creation
```
1. User registers ‚Üí Gets USER role
2. Creates organization ‚Üí Becomes OWNER
3. Organization gets default event space
4. User can access organization dashboard
5. Stats are calculated correctly
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-User Organization
```
1. Owner invites new members
2. Members get appropriate roles
3. Role-based permissions work
4. Members can access organization features
5. Only owners can modify critical settings
```

### Scenario 3: Event Space Management
```
1. Default "General" space exists
2. Admins can create new spaces
3. Events can be organized by space
4. Spaces have their own settings
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Email Invitations**: Currently simplified - would need proper email service
2. **Real-time Updates**: Basic implementation - could be enhanced with Supabase real-time
3. **Usage Tracking**: Placeholder implementation - needs actual usage metrics
4. **Billing Integration**: UI ready but payment processing not implemented

## üéØ Next Steps for Full Production

1. **Payment Integration**: Connect Cashfree/Stripe for actual billing
2. **Email Service**: Implement proper invitation emails
3. **Usage Analytics**: Add detailed usage tracking
4. **Advanced Permissions**: More granular role-based permissions
5. **Organization Transfer**: Allow ownership transfer between users
